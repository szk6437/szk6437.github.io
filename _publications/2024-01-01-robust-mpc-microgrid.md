title: "Learning robust model predictive control for voltage control of islanded microgrid"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-01-robust-mpc-microgrid
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a novel learning-based control design for voltage tracking in islanded AC microgrids. By combining Tube-Based Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) with Gaussian Process (GP) regression, the method reduces conservativeness while ensuring stability under nonlinear loads and parametric uncertainties.'
