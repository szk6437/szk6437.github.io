I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at **Penn State**, advised by [Prof. Constantino M. Lagoa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Up7E4UAAAAJ&hl=en). I have the opportunity here to tackle some control problems. Before joining the Nittany Lion family, I received my Master’s degree in **Control Systems Engineering** from **University of Tehran**. During my time there, I had the pleasure of working under the supervision of [Prof. Hamed Kebriaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Mohsen Hamzeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TWwQidoAAAAJ&hl=en).
